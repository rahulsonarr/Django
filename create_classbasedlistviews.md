In Django, you can create a list view by using the Django framework's built-in views and templates, as well as defining a model and setting up the necessary URL patterns. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a simple list view in Django:

1. **Create a Django Project and App** (if you haven't already):
   If you haven't already created a Django project and app, you can do so by running the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject project_name
   cd project_name
   python manage.py startapp app_name
   ```

   Replace `project_name` and `app_name` with your desired project and app names.

2. **Define a Model**:
   In your app, define a model in the `models.py` file. This model represents the data you want to display in your list view. For example:

   ```python
   # app_name/models.py
   from django.db import models

   class Item(models.Model):
       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       description = models.TextField()

       def __str__(self):
           return self.name
   ```

3. **Create a List View**:
   Create a list view by defining a class-based view. You can use Django's `ListView` for this purpose. In your `views.py` file:

   ```python
   # app_name/views.py
   from django.views.generic import ListView
   from .models import Item

   class ItemListView(ListView):
       model = Item
       template_name = 'item_list.html'  # Create this template in the next step
       context_object_name = 'items'
   ```

4. **Create a Template**:
   Create an HTML template that will be used to render the list view. Create a file named `item_list.html` in your app's `templates` folder:

   ```html
   <!-- app_name/templates/item_list.html -->
   <h1>Item List</h1>
   <ul>
       {% for item in items %}
           <li>{{ item.name }} - {{ item.description }}</li>
       {% endfor %}
   </ul>
   ```

5. **Create URL Patterns**:
   Define the URL pattern in your app's `urls.py` to map the list view to a URL:

   ```python
   # app_name/urls.py
   from django.urls import path
   from .views import ItemListView

   urlpatterns = [
       path('items/', ItemListView.as_view(), name='item-list'),
   ]
   ```

6. **Include App URLs**:
   Include your app's URLs in the project's `urls.py`:

   ```python
   # project_name/urls.py
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('app_name/', include('app_name.urls')),  # Replace 'app_name' with your app's name
   ]
   ```

7. **Run Migrations and Start the Development Server**:
   Run migrations to create the database table for your model:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Now, if you navigate to `http://localhost:8000/app_name/items/` (replace `app_name` with your app's name), you should see your list view displaying the items from your database.
