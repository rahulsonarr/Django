To create a new app in a Django project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Django Project Directory:**
   Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where your Django project is located.

2. **Run the `startapp` Command:**
   To create a new app, you can use the `startapp` management command provided by Django. Replace `myapp` with the name you want to give to your app.

   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```

   This command will create a new directory named `myapp` (or whatever name you specified) within your project's directory. Inside this directory, Django will generate the necessary files and directories for your app.

3. **Configure Your App:**
   Django will create several files and directories within your new app directory. Here are some of the key files and their purposes:

   - `models.py`: This is where you define your data models using Python classes.
   - `views.py`: This is where you define the views (functions or classes) that handle HTTP requests and control the logic of your app.
   - `urls.py`: This is where you define URL patterns that map to views.
   - `admin.py`: This is where you can register your models to make them available in the Django admin interface.
   - `apps.py`: This file contains app configuration settings.

4. **Add Your App to the Project Settings:**
   To use your newly created app in your Django project, you need to add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your project's settings. Open the `settings.py` file located in your project's main directory and add the name of your app to the list.

   ```python
   # settings.py

   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ...
       'myapp',
       # ...
   ]
   ```

5. **Create and Apply Migrations (if needed):**
   If your app includes data models, you should create migrations and apply them to create the corresponding database tables. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations myapp
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

   Replace `myapp` with the name of your app.

6. **Create Views, Templates, and URL Patterns:**
   Define views in your app's `views.py`, create templates for rendering HTML, and define URL patterns in your app's `urls.py`. These steps are crucial for defining the behavior and user interface of your app.

7. **Start Developing Your App:**
   You can now start developing your app by writing views, templates, and any other necessary code specific to your app's functionality.

8. **Include the App URLs in the Project URLs (Optional):**
   If your app has its own set of URLs, you can include them in the project's URL configuration. Open the project's `urls.py` and include your app's URL patterns using the `include` function:

   ```python
   # project/urls.py

   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),  # Include your app's URLs here
   ]
   ```

   Replace `myapp` with the name of your app.

That's it! You've successfully created a new app within your Django project and configured it to be part of your project. You can now continue developing your app's functionality.
