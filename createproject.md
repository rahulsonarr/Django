Creating a Django project using a virtual environment is a best practice to ensure a clean and isolated development environment. Here are the steps to create a Django project within a virtual environment:

1. **Create a Project Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment. Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
   - This command creates a virtual environment named `myenv` in your current directory.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - Activate the virtual environment. The activation command varies depending on your operating system:
   
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       myenv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     
     - On macOS and Linux:
       ```bash
       source myenv/bin/activate
       ```

   - Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that you are now working within the virtual environment.

4. **Install Django**:
   - While the virtual environment is active, you can install Django using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install django
     ```

5. **Create a Django Project**:
   - With Django and the virtual environment installed, you can now create a new Django project. Replace `projectname` with the desired name for your project:
     ```bash
     django-admin startproject projectname
     ```

6. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change your working directory to the newly created project directory:
     ```bash
     cd projectname
     ```

7. **Configure the Database**:
   - By default, Django uses SQLite as its database. You can change the database settings in the `settings.py` file of your project.

8. **Apply Migrations**:
   - To create the initial database schema and apply migrations, run the following commands:
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

9. **Create a Superuser** (Optional):
   - If you want to access the Django admin interface, you can create a superuser account using the following command:
     ```bash
     python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

10. **Start the Development Server**:
    - Start the Django development server by running the following command:
      ```bash
      python manage.py runserver
      ```

11. **Access the Admin Interface** (Optional):
    - If you created a superuser in step 9, you can access the admin interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. Log in with the superuser credentials to manage your application's data.

12. **Start Building Your Project**:
    - You can now start building your Django project within the isolated virtual environment. Create views, templates, models, and URLs according to your project's requirements.

Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working on your project by running the `deactivate` command (on macOS and Linux) or `myenv\Scripts\deactivate` (on Windows).
